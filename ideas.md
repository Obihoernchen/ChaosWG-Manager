- use AJAX so we don't have to reload the whole page (single page with dynamic content)
- show timedelta to now instead of date?
- navbar activate (darker button) active page: `<li class="active">`
- proper timezone support
- disallow move from 0 to 2 directly
- task interval (auto set to todo)
- use jinja2 dictsort for tasks?


- add/delete task button
- optimize the users=User.get_all() on all templates (cache it or something).


- get task history from history table for each task and show in details (who did the task and when)
