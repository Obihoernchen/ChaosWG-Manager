- use AJAX so we don't have to reload the whole page (single page with dynamic content)
- proper timezone support
- task interval (auto set to todo)
- use jinja2 dictsort for tasks?

- delete task button
- optimize the users=User.get_all() on all templates (cache it or something).

- get task history from history table for each task and show in details (who did the task and when)

- history diagram of all users (X different lines)
- normalize y axis (date)
